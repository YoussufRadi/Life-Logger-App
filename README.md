An adroid App for logging Life Events

Recalling a memory from the past could be difficult task. One of the techniques used to store a memory is to store it in a visualized building in your mind, and later on you navigate this building to find your memory. In this project, we want to build a 3D environment that allow people to store their important memories in a VR world. Later on, they can revisit this VR world to recall their memories. The world could be build using abstract objects or from a 3d models scanned from the real world using 3D camera.
